# Workshop Hours

Our workshop logs students hours when the enter and leave the workshop in order to make sure students are accountable for putting in the time necessary to be a contributing member of our team.

Meeting different hour requirements is important for things like:

- Competition / Travel Team Positions  
- Leadership Positions  

## Receiving Credit for Hours

There are two ways to receive credit for the hours you've attended. This first way is to scan your ID in the attendance scanner when you enter and exit the workshop. This attendance scanner can usually be found in the main hallway or near the front door. 

You can also submit your hours retroactively by completing a time log workshop and getting it signed off by a mentor, and then turned into the main inbox.

## Checking Your Hours

You can always view your attendance history by going to the `attendance-data` repository on our Github. Attendance data is posted publicly, but student id numbers are truncated to the last four digits to ensure some privacy. 

You can look at `summary.csv` to get a ranked leaderboard of all students with over 1 hour total logged. You can look at `records.csv` to get a complete list of all in/out entries logged for the current year.

**Build season hours** are usually calculated from the start until the end of build season, and do not incorporate any hours gained before that point. Because of this, the summary build season hours are logged in `buildseason.csv`.

## Incorrect Hours

If you believe that there is a problem with your hours, please first look through `records.csv` for entries with the last four digits of your student ID, and see if there are any majors issues. 

Things like double scans (resulting in mere seconds of added time), or missed days might contribute to an incorrect hour count. For either of these, submitted a manual log sheet is the easiest correction.

If you believe something bigger has happened, email `attendance@team3128.org` for more assistance from one of our mentors.

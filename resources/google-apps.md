# Google Apps Administration

Our team uses Google Apps to control all accounts ending in `@team3128.org`. Usually these accounts are associated with people in leadership positions or who will be representing the team to third parties.

## Email Lists
Our team operates a number of email lists:

- `students@team3128.org` includes all students currently registered for the team. This resets each year.
- `parents@team3128.org` includes all parents of students currently registered for the team. This resets each year.
- `mentors@team3128.org` includes all mentors of the team.
- `leadership@team3128.org` includes all members of the leadership team, including elected and appointed officials.
- Other email lists for smaller committees may be spun off from time to time.

### Administering the email lists.
Leadership members can access the email lists by going to [admin.google.com/team3128.org](http://admin.google.com/team3128.org) and clicking on 'Groups'. Leaders can add or remove members from the groups using this console.

**Note:** Google Drive permissions are often set based on membership to either the students, mentors, or leadership group, so be careful when adding or remove people from those groups.

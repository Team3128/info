##Reading Material
#####I found that reading these things taught me more about tech, or at least got me more interested in it.  Of course, they're also super interesting in their own right.

1. [Reddit Tales from Tech Support](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/)
- A place for people from tech support to share their stories.
- You can pick up a lot about IT from reading it.
- Has all sorts of stories, from school tablet rollouts, to New Zealish Military misadventures, to murder mysteries (seriously!)
2.[The Daily WTF](http://www.thedailywtf.com)
-Blog which shares and makes fun of horrible code readers send in.
-By programmers, for programmers
-You can learn more about good coding conventions from reading this than any CompSci class

# Slack

### What is Slack?
Slack is a chat room system designed to be used for small teams to communicate. NASA, Harvard, and CNN all use Slack to communicate. With it, files can be shared with the members and you can get instant notifications of any activity.

### How do we use Slack?
We use Slack to talk about the team when we may not be in meetings, communicate information between mentors and members, and to inform people about what is happening within the team. Being active on Slack allows you to always be informed of activities within our team.

### How can I join Slack?
Anyone who is a part of Slack can invite others to join. Just ask the mentors or anyone on the team.

### Someone asked me to join Slack. What do I do?
If they are a part of the team, you can let them on. Here's what you should do:

1. Go to [Slack](https://team3128.slack.com/messages/general/) on a browser or the app
2. Locate the "Invite People" button on the left bar of the screen and click it
3. Add their email address and click "Invite"
4. They will then receive an email with instructions to join

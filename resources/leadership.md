## Team Leadership

Our team is led by a group of elected officials and appointed officers. They
meet during the monthly Leadership meeting where the leadership, mentors, and
project leaders discuss the current happenings of the team.

# Elected Positions

Our elected leadership is chosen each May by a team vote. Anyone who has been on
the team for at least one complete build season can self-nominate for an elected
position, to which they will be either be voted on, or appointed to by the
elected President. Positions are: President, Vice President, and Chief Financial
Officer.

# Appointed Positions

Our leadership team and mentors create appointed positions when needed.
Appointed officers are in charge of specific parts of the team that leadership
has deemed necessary. Some appointed officers include: Head of Marketing, Head
of Mechanics, Head of Controls, and Head of Strategy. These positions are
created and terminated at will.

# Leadership Meetings

Each month, the leadership team holds a meeting where they discuss the
happenings of the team and set the course for the overall year. All of the
meetings will happen in the CCA Cage unless otherwise noted, and will be posted
at the beginning of the year.

##Code of Conduct

Our Code of Conduct outlines how members, mentors and parents conduct themselves during all team activities. Our team's goal is to provide:
* An environment where team members can learn, have fun, and feel safe.
* Enviornments where team members can develop supportive relationships, while observing appropriate boundaries.
* Diligent efforts by both students and adults to protect team members from harm.
* Freedom to try new ideas and strategies in different areas of the team.

During the team's activities, the entirety of [Canyon Crest Academy's Discipline Policy](http://cc.sduhsd.net/documents/KeyInfo/Discipline%20Policy15-16.pdf) is in effect, both while on and off campus. We also comply with all requirements listed in [FIRST's Youth Protection Program](http://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-protection-policy).

Any member engaging in team activities represents our team - positively or negatively. Behaving in a manner lower than the standards set will result in disciplinary action including removal from the team.

**Reporting Code Violations**: All students, mentors, and parents aware of a violation of our Code of Condcut, or in doubt about if a behavior is appropriate, is required to immediately consult a Lead Mentor or Canyon Crest Academy Administrator.

## Safety
Our team provides students with unique access to a wide variety of tools. In order to ensure that no member is harmed through the use or misuse of tools, we take safety very seriously.

### Personal Safety
* No team member is to ever work without a mentor or faculty advisor on site.
* Safety glasses are required at all times while in designated areas of the workshop. 
* Loose hair and long clothing must be tied back or removed before a member is permitted to use any machine tools.
* Closed toed shoes must be worn in the workshop at all times. Long pants are recommended.

### Workshop Safety
* Food and drink are allowed in team facilities only at the discretion of adult mentors or faculty advisors.
* Any member intending to use a potentially dangerous tool must have completed a tool certification within the current school year.
* Upon finishing using a tool, it must be returned to its designated location in the workshop. At the end of work sessions, all tools and materials must be put away.
* Tools that malfunction or break must be reported to a mentor immediately.
* Members inside the workshop or computer lab must participate in a robotics related activity. If a member is seen not participating they will be asked to leave the workshop. Horseplay and games will not be tolerated.

Due to the hazardous nature of robotics, Mentors and Faculty Advisors always have the final word in any safety-related situation. Failure to comply with safety rules will result in disciplinary action, including removal from the workshop and possible dismissal from the team.

### Tool Certification
Team members must be trained and certified in workshop tools in order to use them. Tool training may be done by a certified team member, and then verified by a mentor. Tool certifications must be reverified at the beginning of each year, as required knowledge may be change during the year.

## Meeting Times & Locations
All meetings will occur at Canyon Crest Academy from 3pm to 5:30pm unless otherwise noted by the leadership team. General team meetings will occur on Wednesday and Friday, although other events or meetings may be announced.

### FRC Build Season
The FRC Build Season will occur during the official FIRST Build Season, starting at Kickoff and ending on Build Stop Day. During FRC Build, the team will meet all days of the week, except Sunday, unless otherwise noted by the leadership team. FRC Build will not meet the day before finals, or on the first day of finals.

### Tournaments
Each year the team will go to a number of FRC Tournaments to compete with the FRC Robot. While members are welcome to attend tournaments, all official drive team and pit crew positions will be given on strictly a merit basis. 

Memebers may not skip school in order to attend a tournament, unless a properly signed field trip permission form has been received. All students selected for competition positions must attend the full event unless a major immovable academic milestone is in direct conflict.

At tournaments, those are who are not members of Team 3128 but are supporting the team in any way, such as parents and friends, must adhere to these guidelines as well.

## Academic Paramountcy 
Our team recognizes that while robotics is important, a student's academic progress is paramount to a students involvement on our team. Because of this, students that are absent from school are not able to attend robotics on the day(s) they are absent. While there are exceptions to this rule due to uncontrollable circumstances, the general rule is that if a reasonable effort could have been made to attend class, the student must attend class.

##Code of Conduct

Our Code of Conduct outlines how members, mentors and parents conduct themselves during all team activities by providing:
* An environment where team members can learn, have fun, and feel safe.
* Enviornments where team members can develop supportive relationships, while observing appropriate boundaries.
* Diligent efforts by both students and adults to protect team members from harm.

During the team's activities, all [Canyon Crest Academy school rules](http://cc.sduhsd.net/documents/KeyInfo/Discipline%20Policy15-16.pdf) are in effect, either while on-campus or off-campus. We also comply with all requirements listed in [FIRST's Youth Protection Program](http://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-protection-policy).

Any member engaging in team activities represents our team - positively or negatively. Behaving in a manner lower than the standards set will result in disciplinary action including removal from the team.

**Reporting Code Violations**: All students, mentors, and parents aware of a violation of our Code of Condcut, or in doubt about if a behavior is appropriate, is required to immediately consult a Lead Mentor or Canyon Crest Academy Administrator.

### Rules & Safety Agreement

All members that participate in Team 3128's activities must sign (physically or electronically) our Rules & Safety Agreement stating that they will adhere to all rules and guidelines stated in this document. Each year two *crash course* meetings will be held that overviews the team's general workflow and guidelines that members must follow. At that time members will be required to agree to the Rules & Safety Agreement.

If a member joins mid-year, they must agree to the Rules & Safety Agreement by their third meeting.

##Safety Guidelines

Workshop Safety
* No team member is to ever work without a mentor or faculty advisor on site.
* Safety glasses are required at all times while in designated areas of the workshop. 
* Loose hair and long clothing must be tied back or removed before a member is permitted to use any machine tools.
* Closed toed shoes must be worn in the workshop at all times.
* Food and drink are allowed in team facilities only at the discretion of adult mentors or faculty advisors.
* Members inside the workshop or computer lab must participate in a robotics related activity. If a member is seen not participating they will be asked to leave the workshop. Horseplay and games will not be tolerated.

Machine Safety
* Any member intending to use a potentially dangerous tool must have completed a mentor-led tools training session, or have passed a mentor-led tools safety test.
* Upon finishing using a tool, it must be returned to its designated location in the workshop. At the end of work sessions, all tools and materials must be put away.
* If a power tool malfunctions or breaks, it must be reported to a mentor immediately.

Mentors and Faculty Advisors always have the final word in any safety-related situation due to the hazardous nature of robotics.

Failure to comply with the above safety rules will result in disciplinary action, including removal from the workshop and possibly dismissal from the team.

##Participation

###Joining the Team
We do not take applications to join the team. Members may come and go as they wish. Attendance is not mandatory, although members who miss days might not get important information. Most information will be disseminated through email, but this is not 100% guaranteed.

All members must sign a Rules & Safety Agreement to participate on the team.

####Suggested Donation
Due to the high cost of maintaining the robotics program including registration, material costs, and other associated fees, all team members are encouraged to give a suggested donation of $200. 

###FIRST Robotics Competition

* FRC Build will occur during the official FIRST Build Season, starting at Kickoff and ending on Build Stop Day.
* All build will occur on Canyon Crest Academy premises from 3pm to 6pm unless otherwise noted by the leadership team.
* During FRC Build, the team will meet every day from unless otherwise noted by the leadership team.
* FRC Build will not meet the day before finals, or on the first day of finals.

### Tool Certification
Before the FRC Build Season, team members must be trained and certified in workshop tools by attending a mentor-led tool safety workshop. While team members may test out of individual tools, those that choose to must have completed all workshop tools by FRC Build Season in order to participate in FRC Build. If a member has not completed their certification, they must do so with a mentor before they are able to participate in the build-related activities.

### Tournaments
Each year the team will go to a number of FRC Tournaments to compete with the FRC Robot. All tournaments are open to anyone who wishes to participate. However, all official drive team and pit crew positions will be given on strictly a merit basis.

At tournaments, those are who are not members of Team 3128 but are supporting the team in any way, such as parents and friends, must adhere to these guidelines as well.

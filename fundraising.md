Team Fundraising Policy
----

Our team hopes to create a mechanism whereby team members can both contribute towards to total funds of the team, and at the same time allowing them to earn a discount on the total cost of their travel expenses.

## Fundraising Items
Throughout the year, Team 3128 will host fundraisers whereby team members will be able to sell items to their friends, family, and community and earn funds for the team. These items and their prices will be announced at the start of each fundraiser.

## Online
Team fundraising items may be sold online through a provided payment form. Buyers can go to the form and enter their payment details along with the name of the team member that referred them to the program. Buyers can then retrieve their order by providing a printed receipt after school on Wednesdays or Fridays between 3:00-3:15p at the robotics workshop.

##In Person
Team fundraising items may also be sold in person either on-campus or off-campus. Team members will print a item purchase form where they can list the number of items each person has purchased and collect cash and/or checks made payable to Canyon Crest Academy Foundation designated for QUEST. Team members will then submit the form (with their name and email printed legibly) to the designated Sales Coordinator, along with checks/cash payments.

##Order Processing
Both online and in-person orders will be received by the Sales Coordinator. The Sales Coordinator will work with an adult mentor to order the necessary number of items to fulfill all orders. For online orders, individuals will be emailed that their order is ready to be picked up after school at designated times. For in-person orders, team members will be emailed that their order is ready and must distribute the orders correctly.

## Fundraising and Travel Expenses
For all sales designated towards specific team members (either through a field on the online form, or for all in-person orders), 50% of the profits for each sale will counted and can go towards that person's travel expenses. At the time of creating a travel request, the amount will be deducted from your overall total payment required. 

This deduction can only be used as a discount on travel expenses in the same school year as it was earned and cannot be transferred to any other student.

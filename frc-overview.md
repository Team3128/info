# FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)

The FIRST Robotics Competition, abbreviated FRC, is an annual competition where high school teams across the country build robots and compete against each other. It is the main competition Team 3128 involves itself in each year.

Each year, teams are given a game and then have six weeks to build a robot designed to compete in that game. After six weeks, teams put the robot in a bag and bring it to a regional competition where they are randomly matched with and against other robots. Top performing robots move to the World Championship Competition.

## Build Season

The yearly FRC game is announced on the first or second Saturday of the year at the annual **Kickoff event**. During this event, teams learn what the game is and get a set of game pieces and useful parts that can be utilized on the robot. This event marks the start of **Build Season**, which is a period that consists of the six weeks in between Kickoff and Stop Build Day.

Approximately six weeks after the Kickoff event is **Stop Build Day**, where teams place the robot into a plastic bag and are barred from working on the robot unless they are at a competition.

### Practice Robot/Competition Robot
During the Build Season, many teams (including Team 3128) build two identical robots in order to have a robot to continue practicing and testing even after Stop Build Day. 

One robot, deemed the Competition Robot, is bagged and set aside for competition. The Practice Robot is used for continued practice and testing. Any changes made to the Practice Robot during this time are replicated onto the Competition Robot.

## Competition Season

After Build Season concludes, teams compete in a **Regional Competitions**. There are over sixty different competitions across the national held during the six weeks following build season, and our team usually competes in two of them.

Regional Competitions are 3-day events where thirty to sixty teams compete against each other. During each competition has three sets of matches: practice matches, qualification matches, and elimination matches. **Practice matches** allow for teams to test their robot, **Qualification matches** aim to rank the robots based on ability, and **Elimination matches** allow teams to compete to move onto the World Championships.

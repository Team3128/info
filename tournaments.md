Team Tournament/Traveling Policy
----

When going to an event that requires travel, our team will arrange all transportation and lodging. This will allow us to travel as a group which both promotes team spirit as well as gives us access to better deals and a more consistent experience for all team members.

## Travel Costs and Requests
At the beginning of build season, a per-person travel cost will be announced that will cover transportation and lodging for the event. This cost may change on an individual basis depending upon any special accommodations.

Students and families will submit requests with the number of people and any special accommodations required (a family of four split into two rooms). All requests and payment must be submitted before the cut off date, announced at the beginning of build season.

After the cutoff date, refunds can only be issued to those unable to attend if another team member is able to replace the slot. 

## Behavior
Behavior that is deemed below the standards of Team 3128 will result in punishments by a faculty advisor or adult mentor. Severe infractions may result in an immediate flight or bus trip home at the expense of the team member, and/or dismissal from the team.

Prior to the competition, responsibilities like drivers, pit crew, and scouting will be given to team members. It is important to the team that during the competition these responsibilities are maintained. As such, engagement in unrelated activities such as homework or games is prohibited. Members are encouraged to watch matches, meet other people, and look at other team's robots.

## Lodging
Room assignments will be given out prior to departure. Boys and girls will room separately, with an exception for families. Special requests for rooming with a friend should be submitted in both persons travel requests.

## Transportation
Transportation arrangements will be presented to students as soon as they are available. Making special arrangements for travel should be approved through a faculty advisor or adult mentor prior to travel request or payment.

## School Absences
If a member will miss school due to a robotics event, it is that member's responsibility to inform their teachers of absences at least one full week ahead and arrange for completion of all missed work.

If a student misses school due to illness, they may not attend any robotics function later that day. Students may not miss school after a tournament due to fatigue or postponed homework.
